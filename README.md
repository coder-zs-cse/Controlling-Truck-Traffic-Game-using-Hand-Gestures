## General Information
The game will detect the position of player's thumb in the video frame and use that information to control the direction of the truck.
The truck constantly moves in a straight direction. We got control when to move in the left lane or right lane depending upon the traffic up ahead.
The gesture controls make it smooth enough to experience the game lively with hand rather than keyboard.
